### N-mixture model performance and optimal survey design

Choose a scenario of local abundance in sites $\lambda$ and individual availability probability $\phi$ to see single and double observer models performance (relative RMSE curves) and optimal survey effort allocation (optimal number of visits).

### Improving accuracy in abundance estimation by using a double-observer protocol

Increase in model accuracy by using a double-observer protocol when compared to a single observer model (as a baseline).

```{r, ,echo=F, out.width='90%', fig.align='center',fig.cap="Figure: Increase in model performance with the proportion of a double-observer protocol in image review"}
knitr::include_graphics('fig_RMSE_propObs.png')
```

### Reducing fieldwork effort with double observer review

Proportional reduction in fieldwork effort (from $B=2000$ flights) that can be achieved with a full double-observer protocol, while matching the same accuracy of the single observer model (for $p=0.8$).

```{r, ,echo=F, out.width='75%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('fig_RMSE_budgets.png')
```

\  

```{r, ,echo=F, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Proportion of the total effort (budget) of the double observer model (multinomial N-mixture) needed to obtain a similar performance to the single observer model (binomial N-mixture)"}
knitr::include_graphics('tab_reduction_budget.png')
```
